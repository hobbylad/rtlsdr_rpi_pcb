##RTL-SDR and Raspberry Pi 3 Carrier PCB 

An RTL-SDR and Raspberry Pi make a good combination. The RTL-SDR has a range of 24MHz-1.7GHz and the RPi 3 enough power to compile and run a wide range of open-source receiver software.

The aim of this carrier PCB is to mechanically combine both SDR and RPi, reduce wiring, allow the control of external devices such as relays and provide power with some expansion capability. Safety, noise and RPI cooling were also considerations.

The board was designed with Kicad on a single-sided board with the aim of keeping the PCB as simple as possible for hobbyists to construct with chemical etching or a milling machine.
